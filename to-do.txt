To-do
-----
* deploy to DO - Docker 19.03.12 on Ubuntu 20.04
* run certbot
* update readme

Complete
--------
* Add support for the 11 remaining models
* Turn on cascading for groups
    * If group deleted, delete members, models, data, api tokens
* put all da loading bars in models inside cards
* Search for any not translate text values and do translations
* change email urls
* ensure api endpoints are secure, especially the model api. For example, don't let people
    create models in groups they are not a part of
* groups auth seems to be okay, but authenticated users can select other users data, really need to harden my endpoints
    maybe try updating the requires auth decorator
* build public api (with token of course) and throw in some api documentation
* do documentation component
* search for any hardcoded 'localhost' or 'localhost:4200' and update for prd env
* run translate python script

On Hold
-------
* Cascading is slow due to payloads, try  deleting them directly in api instead of cascade
